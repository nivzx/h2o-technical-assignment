# 🌊 H2O.ai Technical Assessment 🧠

## Introduction 🚀

Welcome to this exciting app powered by H2O Wave, utilizing H2O's Deep Learning models! This app aims to predict the vulnerability of patients to future heart diseases based on their current medical data.

It uses [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) containing over 1000 data points for training and validation of the predictive model. The model was trained using H2O's deep learning tools in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14E5uij9zbBW1TdRGGLkAAl-yFF0EeejJ?usp=sharing).

📺 Check out a quick walkthrough of the application in [this video](https://youtu.be/JtG0GZEk6_k)!

## Running the App 🏃‍♂️

Ensure you have activated a Python virtual environment with `h2o-wave` installed.

If you haven't set up a Python environment yet, simply run the following command (assuming Python 3.7 is installed properly):

For MacOS / Linux:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install h2o-wave
```

For Windows:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install h2o-wave
```

Once the virtual environment is set up and active, run:

```sh
wave run app.py
```

This will start the Wave app at <http://localhost:10101>.

## Explore the Predictions 📊

Once you've started the app, Use it to predit the data based on your inputs. You can input different sets of medical data to see how the model predicts the vulnerability of patients to future heart diseases. Experiment with various combinations of input variables to gain insights into the factors influencing the predictions.
