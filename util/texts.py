model_info = '''
This application includes an AI Neural Network which can be used to detect Heart Failures based on patients' health records. This model is based on a dataset collected based on several European and American locations including Cleveland, Hungary and Switzerland. The dataset includes 918 unique data entries, which it uses to train and validate the results of the model. 

Behind the scenes, this app is developed using H2O's Deep Learning tools, known for their ability to train models effectively. It first balances the dataset to obtain higher accuracy during training, and then trains it through multiple hidden layers until desired accuracy is reached. On average, this application provides 0.87 accuracy, which is very impressive.

Once trained, the model is stored in AWS S3 buckets, along with the complete dataset and the validation subset of it. Then the application can get the latest trained model from the S3 bucket, and use for analysis.
